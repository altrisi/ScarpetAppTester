# Scarpet App Tester

This is a mod thought to automatically test multiple events, commands or even functions from Scarpet Apps, in order to check for problems 
before they arise. It will be included in a Github Action when finished.

## Setup

In order to run this, you have two options:

- Wait for me to have time and will to make it at least work
- Code it yourself, make a PR, and wait for more instructions
